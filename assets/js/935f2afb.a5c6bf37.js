It is primarily a conceptual framework that encompasses a set of well-defined abstractions for designing a modern, feature-rich backend application with characteristics such as modularity, cohesion, separation of concerns, information hiding and loose coupling. It also combines elements of FP (Functional Programming) and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming) with mainstream PP (Procedural Programmin) to minimize errors resulting from improper state management and unwanted side effects.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"docs/model/decode":{"id":"docs/model/decode","title":"Decode","description":"","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"docs/model/definition":{"id":"docs/model/definition","title":"Definition","description":"The @mondrian-framework/model package contains a wide range of useful functions for defining a data model schema, from the simplest type string to complex objects, arrays, and unions.
